== What id does?

The stemming process is developed to allow one to find the stem of an word and 
it's not an algorithm where you can get the root of it.

For further reference on stem vs. root, please check wikipedia articles on the topic:

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_(linguistics)
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics)

== Install

 gem install ruby-stemmer

Please not that Windows is not supported at this time.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
